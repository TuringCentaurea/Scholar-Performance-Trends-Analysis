# Scholar Performance Trends: Pandemic Impact Analysis
## Project Background
Following the end of the pandemic, many activities worldwide gradually transitioned from online to offline modes, including changes in teaching methods in schools. This analysis examines the impact of this transition on students' overall performance. Specifically, it investigates data from a UTS course, using datasets from 2021 (676 students) and 2023 (874 students). This research goal aims to assess the impact of the shift in teaching methods, evaluate whether the course structure is well-designed, and determine if adjustments to the teaching model are necessary.     
## Executive Summary
An analysis of 1,550 academic records from 2021 and 2023 reveals a significant decline in student average overall performance following the transition from online to offline teaching modes. The proportion of high-performing students experienced the largest drop, decreasing by 30%, while mid-to-lower performance groups saw significant increases, with Group C rising by 15% and Group P by 10%. However, the transition had no notable impact on the proportions of top-performing or lowest-performing students. A correlation heatmap highlighted the effective design of the course structure, and further analysis confirmed that offering two test opportunities significantly improved average test scores by approximately 10 percentage points. These insights suggest that faculty and course administrators should conduct a more detailed investigation into the reasons behind the decline in high-achieving students, while retaining the current course structure and the strategy of offering two test opportunities, which have proven effective.
